    "headline": "Biden and Trump agree to 2 presidential debates, with first set for June 27 on CNN",
    "content": "Washington CNN — President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have both accepted an invitation from CNN to debate on June 27, a historically early showdown that will set the tone for the final months of the 2024 campaign. “I’ve received and accepted an invitation from @CNN for a debate on June 27th. Over to you, Donald. As you said: anywhere, any time, any place,” Biden said in a post on X. Trump later told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, “The answer is yes, I will accept.” Later Wednesday morning, both men said they had accepted an invitation from ABC to hold a second debate on September 10. The news is the latest development in a quickly escalating tit-for-tat over debates between the two political rivals. Biden’s campaign earlier called on Trump to join him for two presidential debates hosted by news organizations and formally informed the Commission on Presidential Debates that the president will not participate in its previously scheduled fall debates. The former president quickly said he was on board with earlier debates and told radio host Hugh Hewitt that he would accept any moderator. Biden only recently said that he was happy to debate Trump, though he was non-committal on the format of such a debate, telling radio host Howard Stern, “I’m happy to debate him.” In a social media video and a subsequent letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates, Biden’s campaign laid out its proposed terms, including possible debate dates in June and September.",

    "content": "A team of researchers from Stanford University has developed a new battery technology that offers ten times the energy storage capacity of current lithium-ion batteries. This breakthrough could revolutionize electric vehicles, renewable energy storage, and portable electronics. The new battery design uses a novel electrode material that allows for a significantly higher density of lithium ions to be stored. This leads to a much longer battery life and faster charging times. The researchers are currently working on scaling up the production process for this new battery technology and hope to bring it to market within the next few years.",
